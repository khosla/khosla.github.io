I am an Assistant Professor in the Multimedia Computing Group in the Intelligent Systems Department at TU Delft. My primary area of research is machine learning on graph structured data. In particular, my research is dedicated to the development of cutting-edge algorithms that facilitate effective, interpretable, and privacy-preserving machine learning on graph data. I am currently spearheading a novel research line focused on exploring the intricate relationship between explainability and privacy in machine learning. Prior to my being a faculty member at TUD, I was a senior researcher at the L3S Research Centre, and the Leibniz University Hannover. I have also managed several collaborative projects both in Academia and in the industry where I spent a three-year stint after my PhD. I completed my PhD from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics (MPII), in Algorithms and the Complexity group, Saarbruecken, Germany.
