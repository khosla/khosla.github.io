ðŸŽ‰ **New preprint:** [Population-Scale Network Embeddings Expose Educational Divides in Network Structure Related to Right-Wing Populist Voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21236).

We embed the entire Dutch population across neighborhood, work, family, household, and school contexts, and uncover education-linked structural differences associated with right-wing populist voting using the [dimensional interpretability of node embeddings](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10591463).
